# Event-Management-Ghazi

The Event management system is a system where the event organizer can start the planning phase of the events this is what my management system aims to do, my management system includes both the events and the people attending the events.
An example of the Events that can be organized using the program is Conferences, Weddings and Meetups.

I was Unable to continue Task3 and Task4 because of the issue that i got stuck on in Task2.
